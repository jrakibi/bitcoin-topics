## Programming bitcoin Script Transaction

In this project you will build your own bitcoin stack machine from cratch and run your own bitcoin ops (operations)...

Adding 2+2 in bitcoin Script starting from zero / scratch:

<SvgDisplay
    src="/bitcoin-topics/static/images/topics/p2pk/stack.png"
    width="60%"
    height="auto"
/>

bitcoin script notation reads:

```
ScriptSig (input):    ?
ScriptPubKey:         OP_2 OP_ADD OP_4 OP_EQUAL
```

If you check all bitcoin script operations -
the following ops should no longer be a mystery:

Constants

| Word           | Opcode | Hex       | Input    | Output        | Description                                                                                             |
| -------------- | ------ | --------- | -------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| OP_0, OP_FALSE | 0      | 0x00      | Nothing. | (empty value) | An empty array of bytes is pushed onto the stack. (This is not a no-op: an item is added to the stack.) |
| OP_1, OP_TRUE  | 81     | 0x51      | Nothing. | 1             | The number 1 is pushed onto the stack.                                                                  |
| OP_2-OP_16     | 82-96  | 0x52-0x60 | Nothing. | 2-16          | The number in the word name (2-16) is pushed onto the stack.                                            |
