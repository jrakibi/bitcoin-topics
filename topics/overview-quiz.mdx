## Ex 1: Opcodes

Challenge your understanding of Bitcoin opcodes.

<Quiz
    questions={[
        {
            question:
                "Which opcode is used to duplicate the top item on the stack?",
            options: ["OP_DUP", "OP_SWAP", "OP_DROP", "OP_OVER"],
            correctAnswer: "OP_DUP",
            explanation:
                "OP_DUP duplicates the top item on the stack, making it useful for scripts that need to use the same data twice."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the primary purpose of OP_CHECKSIG?",
            options: [
                "To verify a digital signature",
                "To perform bitwise operations",

                "To push a constant value onto the stack"
            ],
            correctAnswer: "To verify a digital signature",
            explanation:
                "OP_CHECKSIG verifies that the signature is valid for the provided public key and message hash."

            correctAnswer: "Cryptographic",
            explanation:
                "OP_SHA256 is a cryptographic operation that applies the SHA-256 hash function to the top stack item."

## Ex 2: Locking and Unlocking

Letâ€™s see how well you understand the core concepts of locking and unlocking scripts, which are key to securing and spending Bitcoin transactions.

<Quiz
    questions={[
        {
            question: "What is another name for a Locking Script?",
            options: ["ScriptSig", "Witness", "ScriptPubKey", "OP_CHECKSIG"],
            correctAnswer: "ScriptPubKey",
            explanation:
                "The Locking Script is also known as a ScriptPubKey. It is used to define the conditions under which an output can be spent."
        },
        {
            question:
                "Which part of a Bitcoin transaction contains the Unlocking Script?",
            options: [
                "The input",
                "The output",
                "The transaction fee",
                "The coinbase"
            ],
            correctAnswer: "The input",
            explanation:
                "The Unlocking Script is provided for every input you want to spend in a transaction. It contains the necessary data to satisfy the conditions of the corresponding Locking Script."
        },
        {
            question:
                "In what order are the scripts executed when validating a transaction?",
            options: [
                "Locking Script first, then Unlocking Script",
                "Unlocking Script first, then Locking Script",
                "Both are executed simultaneously",
                "They are not executed during validation"
            ],
            correctAnswer: "Unlocking Script first, then Locking Script",
            explanation:
                "The Unlocking Script is executed first, and its result is then passed to the Locking Script. If the Locking Script is satisfied, the transaction is considered valid."
        },
        {
            question:
                "What happens if the Unlocking Script does not satisfy the Locking Script?",
            options: [
                "The transaction is added to the blockchain with a penalty",
                "The transaction is discarded and not added to the blockchain",
                "The transaction fee is increased",
                "The transaction is sent back for re-validation"
            ],
            correctAnswer:
                "The transaction is discarded and not added to the blockchain",
            explanation:
                "If the Unlocking Script does not satisfy the Locking Script, the transaction is considered invalid and is not added to the blockchain."
        },
        {
            question:
                "Which of the following is NOT true about a Locking Script?",
            options: [
                "It is placed on every output in a transaction",
                "It specifies the conditions for spending an output",
                "It is also known as a ScriptSig",
                "It can include cryptographic operations like OP_CHECKSIG"
            ],
            correctAnswer: "It is also known as a ScriptSig",
            explanation:
                "The Locking Script is not known as a ScriptSig; that term refers to the Unlocking Script. The Locking Script is known as a ScriptPubKey."

## Ex 3: Data

Implement the `OP_PUSHDATA2` logic in the `parseOpPushData` function.

1. Open `parseOpPushData.js`
2. Find the `TODO` comment for `OP_PUSHDATA2`
3. Implement logic to handle opcode 0x4d
4. Read 2 bytes for data length, then slice the data
5. Return formatted string like other `OP_PUSHDATA` operations

## Ex 4: Script Success and Failure

This quiz will test your understanding of what makes a Bitcoin script valid or invalid, focusing on the conditions that lead to script success or failure.

<Quiz
