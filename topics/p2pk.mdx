The first bitcoin transaction was a P2PK transaction in [block 170](https://mempool.space/tx/f4184fc596403b9d638783cf57adfe4c75c605f6356fbc91338530e9831e9e16), where Satoshi Nakamoto sent 10 BTC to Hal Finney

We will explore this transaction in detail to understand how P2PK works, from its creation to its validation. (Understanding P2PK serves as an ideal foundation for more complex scripts)

**TLDR:** P2PK allows bitcoins to be sent directly to a _public key_. To spend the bitcoins, the recipient must provide a _valid signature_.

<ExpandableAlert title="NOTE" type="info">
    Despite being simple, P2PK is not as widely used as P2PKH. We'll cover why
    this is the case later on.

### How does it work ?

The ability to lock and unlock coins is the mechanism by which we transfer bitcoin.  
**Locking** is giving bitcoins to someone.  
**Unlocking** is spending bitcoins that you have received.

#### 1- Locking (ScriptPubKey):

    />
</div>
When creating this P2PK transaction, Satoshi specifies **Finney's public key in
the ScriptPubKey**.

      This script specifies the conditions that must be met to spend the bitcoins in the future, and it's placed within the output of a transaction.

    **ScriptPubKey**: A P2PK locking script looks like this:

```
<Public key Finney> OP_CHECKSIG
```

Click on **Output 1** of the transaction below to view the scriptPubKey that Satoshi used to lock 10 BTC to Finney's public key and see this in action.

Some have [speculated](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/5960) that Satoshi was unaware of public key compression.

It wasn't until Pieter Wuille discovered that the compressed SEC format existed in OpenSSL that people start using it.  
The advantage of using Compressed pub key is:  
their public keys are smaller => smaller transaction on the network => save block space

#### 2- Unlocking (ScriptSig)

To spend bitcoin that Satoshi sent, Finney must provide a valid signature corresponding to the public key.

    This signature proves that Finney has the private key corresponding to the public key specified in the ScriptPubKey.

**ScriptSig:** A P2PK Unlocking script looks like this:

```
<Signature Finney>
```

Click on **Input 1** of this transaction to view the scriptSig created by Hal Finney.

/>

-   **OP_PUSHBYTES_71**: (47 in Hex) Length of the signature (71 bytes).
-   **30442 ... 914f01**: Signature followed by SigHash byte

#### 3- Validation

bitcoin uses **Script**, a stack-based scripting language, to validate transactions.  
It processes commands from left to right and is intentionally designed to be non-Turing complete, lacking features like loops.

When validating a transaction, the ScriptSig and ScriptPubKey are combined. This concatenated script looks something like this:

```
<signature Finney> <public key Finney> OP_CHECKSIG
```

The combined script will validate if the signature is valid, but fail if the signature is invalid.

The ScriptSig will only unlock the ScriptPubKey if the signature is valid for that public key. In other words, only someone with knowledge of the private key can produce a valid ScriptSig.

<ExpandableAlert title="NOTE" type="info">
    For the script to be valid, the top element of the stack must be non-zero
    after evaluation
</ExpandableAlert>

You can play with this tool below to see step by step how we evaluate P2PK the stack

In the previous example, Signature and Public Key are elements, while OP_CHECKSIG is an operation. To understand the difference between an Element and an Operation, read this.

**Elements:** Data pushed onto the stack.

-   **Type:** Byte strings (1 to 520 bytes).
-   **Example:** `Signatures` or `public keys`

**Operations:** Commands that manipulate stack elements.

-   **Type:** Consume and push elements.
-   **Example:** `OP_DUP`, `OP_HASH160`, `OP_CHECKSIG`

### Example: OP_CHECKSIG

1. **OP_CHECKSIG**
    - **Function:** Verifies the ECDSA signature.
    - **Stack Operation:** Consumes 2 elements (pubkey and signature) and pushes 1 element (1 (TRUE) if valid, 0 (FALSE) if not).

| Type          | Description                      | Example       | Consumption | Push            |

| **Element**   | Data for the stack               | DER Signature | N/A         | N/A             |
| **Operation** | Duplicates the top stack element | OP_DUP        | 0 elements  | 1 element       |
| **Operation** | Hashes the top stack element     | OP_HASH160    | 1 element   | 1 element       |
| **Operation** | Verifies a signature             | OP_CHECKSIG   | 2 elements  | 1 element (0/1) |

### Problems with P2PK

-   **❌ Public keys are long:** Your username on a website is usually less than 20 characters, but bitcoin public keys are far larger, posing a practical issue. Uncompressed public keys contain 65 bytes, resulting in 130 hexadecimal characters when converted, and compressed keys have 33 bytes, which doubles to 66 characters in hexadecimal. This is because each byte is represented by two hexadecimal characters (1 byte = 8 bits = 2 × 4 bits)
-   **❌ Larger public keys = larger UTXO:** These keys must be stored and indexed, requiring more resources for full nodes.
-   **❌ If ECDSA is broken**, these outputs could be stolen because everyone can see the public key in the scriptPubKey field.
