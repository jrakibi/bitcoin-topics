Locking and Unlocking script are used to define the conditions under which a transaction can be spent.

## Locking Script

A locking script, also known as a ScriptPubKey, is placed on every output you create in a transaction. It specifies the conditions that must be met for the output to be spent.

## Unlocking Script

An unlocking script, also known as a ScriptSig or Witness, is provided for every input you want to spend in a transaction. It contains the data needed to satisfy the conditions set by the locking script.

## Execution

When a transaction is processed, each node in the network checks both the locking and unlocking scripts for each input.

The unlocking script is executed first, followed by the locking script.

If the unlocking script successfully satisfies the conditions set by the locking script, the transaction is considered valid and is added to the blockchain.
Otherwise, it is rejected.
