Community is a crucial part of any educational process, especially when it comes to understanding bitcoin. No learning material can match the value of a personal conversation with someone who understands your needs and can guide you effectively.

We use Discord as our main community hub for bitcoin topics. By joining, you can ask questions, get help, and chat with fellow learners.

It's a fantastic place to meet others who are navigating the bitcoin topics and get support when you find yourself stuck on a challenging concept.

## Joining Discord
