## P2PKH ScriptPubKey Decoder

In this exercise, you'll decode a Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash (P2PKH) ScriptPubKey from hex to Assembly (ASM) format.

1. Examine each byte of the ScriptPubKey.
2. Determine if it's an Opcode, Data, or Data Length.
3. Click the corresponding button.
4. Continue until you've decoded the entire script.

<ScriptDecoder scriptHex="76A91433f5a20ff6a0fa36a55c6149cd32db04a1054fb288AC" />

This will help you understand the structure of P2PKH scripts, a fundamental part of bitcoin transactions.

After completing, you should recognize the standard P2PKH ScriptPubKey structure:

```
OP_DUP OP_HASH160 [20-byte public key hash] OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG
```

1. The process starts with a hex string representing the ScriptPubKey.
2. The hex is converted to a sequence of bytes.
3. These bytes are then processed one at a time:

    - If a byte is between 0x01 and 0x4b (1-75), it indicates that the next n bytes should be read as a data element.
    - If the byte is greater than 0x4b, it represents an opcode.

4. For data elements:

    - The bytes are kept as hex in the ASM representation.

5. For opcodes:

    - The byte is converted to its corresponding symbolic name (e.g., 0x76 becomes OP_DUP).

6. Special cases for longer data elements:

    - OP_PUSHDATA1 (0x4c): The next byte indicates how many subsequent bytes to read as data.
    - OP_PUSHDATA2 (0x4d): The next two bytes indicate how many subsequent bytes to read as data.
    - OP_PUSHDATA4 (0x4e): The next four bytes indicate how many subsequent bytes to read as data.

7. The decoded elements (both data and opcodes) are then joined together with spaces to form the final ASM string.

8. This process allows for the conversion of any ScriptPubKey from its raw byte representation to a more human-readable format, regardless of the specific script type (P2PK, P2PKH, or others).
